    <p>Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah) <br>
        Then we'll shoot across the (symphony)<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
        Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the (oh-ah-oh-ah)<br>
        Symphony<br>
        (So high, so high)<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the sky<br><br>
        
        Oh, angels sent from up above<br>
        You know you make my world light up<br>
        When I was down, when I was hurt<br>
        You came to lift me up<br>
        Life is a drink, and love's a drug<br>
        Oh now I think I must be miles up<br>
        When I was hurt, withered, dried up<br>
        You came to rain a flood<br><br>
        
        So drink from me, drink from me<br>
        When I was so thirsty<br>
        We're on a symphony<br>
        Now I just can't get enough<br>
        Put your wings on me, wings on me<br>
        When I was so heavy<br>
        We're on a symphony<br>
        When I'm lower, lower, lower, low<br><br>
        
        Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
        Got me feeling drunk and high<br>
        So high, so high<br>
        Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
        I'm feeling drunk and high<br>
        So high, so high<br>
        (Woo)<br>
        (Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)<br><br>
        
        Oh, angels sent from up above<br>
        I feel it coursing through my blood<br>
        Life is a drink, your love's about<br>
        To make the stars come out<br><br>
        
        Put your wings on me, wings on me<br>
        When I was so heavy<br>
        We're on a symphony<br>
        When I'm lower, lower, lower, low<br><br>
        
        Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
        Got me feeling drunk and high<br>
        So high, so high<br>
        Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
        I'm feeling drunk and high<br>
        So high, so high<br><br>
        
        Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
        So high, so high<br>
        Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah<br>
        I'm feeling drunk and high<br>
        So high, so high<br><br>
        
        Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the (then we'll shoot)<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the sky<br>
        Then we'll shoot across the<br><br></p>
